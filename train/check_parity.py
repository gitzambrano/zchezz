train/check_parity.py — Python/C HalfKP-4Bucket feature parity check

APPROACH TAKEN: **compile and invoke the real C code**, not a JSON hand-off.

engine/c/zchezz_v400/nnue.c is self-contained (it defines its own
PC_COLOR/PC_TYPE/COL_W/COL_B macros and only includes nnue.h + the C
standard library — no dependency on board.h/board.c), and it already
exposes exactly the three functions this parity check needs as public API
in nnue.h:

    int nnue_feature_index(uint8_t p, int zsq, int white_pov, int bucket);
    int nnue_king_bucket_w(int wk_zsq);
    int nnue_king_bucket_b(int bk_zsq);

None of the three touch the loaded-weights globals, so they can be called
without ever calling nnue_load() first. This script therefore:

  1. Writes a tiny C driver (`_parity_driver.c`, generated into this
     directory's `.tmp/` subfolder, not checked in) whose `main()` reads
     one test case per line from stdin and prints the corresponding C
     function's result, one integer per line, to stdout.
  2. Compiles `nnue.c` + the driver into `_parity_driver.exe` via the
     first of `cc`/`gcc` found on PATH.
  3. Generates a batch of test cases in Python from real (legal, randomly
     played) positions via encoding.py + python-chess, feeds them to the
     compiled driver over a subprocess pipe, and asserts the C output
     equals the Python-computed expected value for every case.
  4. Also compiles+runs nnue.c's own built-in `-DNNUE_TEST` self-test
     (its `main()`, already present in nnue.c) as an extra sanity gate —
     it hardcodes a handful of known-correct (king_bucket, feature_index)
     values independent of anything in this script, so it catches a
     class of bug (e.g. accidentally testing against Python's OWN bug)
     that a self-referential Python-vs-C diff alone cannot.

FALLBACK (only used if no C compiler is found on PATH): the instructions
for this task allow, as a fallback, "emit a JSON of (fen -> sorted active
feature indices for both perspectives) that a C test can consume." If step
2 above fails (no `cc`/`gcc`), this script falls back to writing exactly
that JSON file (`parity_fixtures.json`) instead of failing outright, and
prints instructions for wiring it into a future NNUE_TEST-style C
consumer. On this development machine, gcc IS available (C:\\mingw64\\bin\\
gcc.exe), so the compile-and-run path is the one actually exercised by
`python check_parity.py`.

Why THIS split of responsibilities (king bucket + feature index tested
directly, not "run a full nnue_eval and diff the cp score"): nnue_eval()
needs loaded weights to produce a meaningful number, and a value
comparison there would only prove "the same weights produce the same
number when fed through two implementations of the same arithmetic" —
useful, but it would NOT localize a bug to the feature encoding
specifically the way this script does. Since the single highest-risk
failure mode called out in nnue.h/the plan is a coordinate/index
convention mismatch (not a floating-point arithmetic bug), testing
`nnue_feature_index`/`nnue_king_bucket_w/b` directly against
encoding.py's `king_bucket`/`halfkp_active_indices` is the sharpest tool
for exactly that risk.
