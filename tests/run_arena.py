run_arena.py — driver for engine/c/tools/arena.c
=================================================

arena.exe already knows how to play two IN-PROCESS kinds of player
("net:<weights.nnu4>" and "uci:<already-built .exe>") against each
other or in a round-robin/gauntlet — see engine/c/tools/arena.c's
header comment for the full design (Appendix F.4 of
docs/v400_implementation_plan.md).

NOTE ON THE BUILD LAYOUT: engine/c/tools/arena.c is SHARED across
engine versions (it tracks the current engine API only, see
README.md's engine/c/tools/ file inventory) and is built via engine/build/Makefile,
which places arena.exe in engine/build/ — NOT inside any
engine/c/zchezz_vXXX/ folder. zchezz.exe, by contrast, is still built
per-version inside its own engine/c/zchezz_vXXX/ folder (see
ENGINE_DIR_FOR_HEAD below) since it IS the per-version release
artifact.

What arena.exe does NOT know how to do is turn "compare against
v3.14" or "compare against a git tag" into an actual .exe. That is
this script's ONLY job: resolve engine references from git into built
zchezz.exe binaries, register them as uci: players, and hand the
whole player list to arena.exe. Everything else (game playing, Elo,
SPRT, cross-table, anchors) is arena.exe's job — this script does not
reimplement any of that, it only shells out and streams arena.exe's
own stdout/stderr through.

NOTE ON ABSOLUTE/ANCHOR ELO: arena.c deliberately does NOT have a
Stockfish-anchor / known-strength mode (see that file's header comment
"NO STOCKFISH-ANCHORED ABSOLUTE ELO HERE") — this native path exists
to compare two engine VERSIONS quickly (Appendix F.4/F.5's SPRT gate),
not to benchmark against an external reference at a calibrated
strength. For absolute Elo vs Stockfish, use
tests/run_tournament.py's ANCHORS mechanism directly; this script has
no anchor syntax to forward.

── PLAYER REFERENCE SYNTAX ─────────────────────────────────────────

  net:<weights-file>       passed straight through to arena.exe unchanged.
  uci:<path>            passed straight through to arena.exe unchanged
                         (already-built .exe — including Stockfish).
  ref:<gitref>          a git ref (branch, tag, or commit sha) OR the
                         literal word HEAD. This script builds it (see
                         "BUILD RESOLUTION" below) and rewrites it to
                         a uci:<built exe path> before invoking
                         arena.exe. This is the ONLY spec kind this
                         script actually does work for.

── BUILD RESOLUTION ────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ref == "HEAD" (case-insensitive): built IN PLACE, in this checkout's
  own active engine folder (resolved from engine/ACTIVE_ENGINE — see
  ENGINE_DIR_FOR_HEAD below), no git worktree involved. This is the
  common "test my current uncommitted work" case — a worktree can only
  check out a COMMITTED ref, so a dirty working tree has to be built
  where it lives. Rebuilt only if any of its own sources is newer than
  the cached zchezz.exe (mtime check), so repeated runs during
  iterative development don't pay a rebuild every time.

  Any other ref: resolved to a commit sha via `git rev-parse <ref>`
  (this is the CACHE KEY — re-running with the same ref that already
  resolves to a cached sha never rebuilds, even if the ref's branch
  tip has since moved — pin an explicit sha if you want that). A
  temporary `git worktree add --detach` checks out that commit, this
  script finds the ENGINE FOLDER inside it (the project's convention
  is one folder per version — engine/c/zchezz_vXXX/ — and which one
  existed at an arbitrary historical commit is not knowable in
  advance, so this script picks the highest-numbered
  engine/c/zchezz_v* folder present in that worktree), builds it with
  the exact native-build command from CLAUDE.md's "Build Instructions"
  section (mirrored here, see BUILD_CMD_TEMPLATE), copies the
  resulting zchezz.exe (+ nnue_weights.bin, if the folder has one — a
  build without its own weights would silently fall back to whatever
  nnue_weights.bin happens to be in the CURRENT working directory when
  arena.exe spawns it, which is almost never what you want when
  comparing two different versions) into a persistent cache directory
  keyed by the commit sha, then removes the temporary worktree.

  A ref that fails to resolve/build is reported to stderr and DROPPED
  from the player list rather than aborting the whole run — matching
  the task's explicit requirement that one bad ref must not sink an
  otherwise-runnable match. If fewer than 2 players survive, this
  script exits with an error (arena.exe itself would also refuse).

── CACHE LAYOUT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  <repo_root>/.arena_build_cache/<sha>/zchezz.exe (+ nnue_weights.bin,
  tablebases/ symlink if present). Safe to delete entirely at any
  time — everything in it is reproducible from git.

── USAGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  python tests/run_arena.py --player ref:HEAD --player ref:v3.14 \\
      --games 100 --movetime 100 --threads 8 \\
      --openings openings/lines/8moves_v3.pgn --sprt --elo0 0 --elo1 5

  python tests/run_arena.py --player net:gen6.nnu4 --player net:gen5.nnu4 \\
      --games 400 --movetime 30 --threads 16 --sprt --elo0 0 --elo1 5 \\
      --json gate_result.json          # Appendix F.5 promote/discard gate

  python tests/run_arena.py --player ref:HEAD --player ref:v3.14 --player ref:main \\
      --games 50 --movetime 100 --threads 8 --pgn cross_version.pgn   # mini-tournament

Every arena.exe flag not related to player resolution (--games,
--threads, --movetime, --nodes, --max-plies, --openings,
--opening-plies, --seed, --tt-mb, --gauntlet, --sprt, --elo0, --elo1,
--alpha, --beta, --uci-timeout, --json, --pgn, --bin, --epd) is
forwarded — this script does not re-parse or duplicate their meaning,
see FORWARD_VALUE_FLAGS and the DEFAULT CONFIGURATION block below
(project convention: every CLI-settable option needs a documented
top-of-file default here too, same as the v3.14 Python test harnesses
already do).

── OUTPUT FORMATS: --pgn / --bin / --epd (additive, not either/or) ───

  --pgn FILE   standard PGN, GUI-loadable.
  --bin FILE   packed training samples (sample.h/dataset.py format).
               arena.exe HARD-REFUSES this unless every resolved
               player is net: and shares the SAME weight file — see
               arena.c's --bin gate. Since this script's ref:/uci:
               players always resolve to uci: (a built .exe, not an
               in-process net), --bin only works with --player
               net:<path> specs, and only when they're the same file.
               This is deliberate, not a limitation to work around:
               sample.h's eval_cp has no per-row evaluator-identity
               field, so a mixed-engine --bin run would silently blend
               two different engines' opinions into one training
               column (CLAUDE.md rule 10).
  --epd FILE   FEN + c0/c1/c2/c3 opcode rows. NO such restriction —
               c2 records the actual mover's player name per row, so
               a ref:HEAD-vs-ref:v3.14 or net:-vs-Stockfish run is
               fine here; a downstream consumer can filter/group on
               c2 if it only wants one evaluator's rows.

── CONFIGURATION NAMES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Every tool uses the same constant name for the same concept, so a value
means the same thing whichever tool you are reading. The full list lives in
ONE place: utils/cliconf.py, section "SHARED CONFIGURATION VOCABULARY".
A `DEFAULT_` prefix marks a knob specific to this tool alone.

SAVE_PGN / SAVE_EPD / SAVE_BIN are independent switches, not a choice of
one: any combination can be on in the same run.

# of the same literal. Edit these to change this script's defaults
# without touching argparse; edit argparse only to change flag names.
#
# These are kept in sync BY HAND with arena.c's own ARENA_DEFAULT_*
# block (engine/c/tools/arena.c) — arena.exe would apply
# those same defaults anyway if a flag were omitted, but per the
# project's config-block convention this script forwards an explicit
# value for every numeric/boolean flag rather than relying on the
# child process's own defaults silently. Path-like flags (openings/
# json/pgn/gauntlet) default to "" (not forwarded at all — see
